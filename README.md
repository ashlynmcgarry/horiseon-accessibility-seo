# Horiseon Accessibility Optimisation

## Description

This codebase has been optimised for marketing agency, Horiseon, to ensure their website adheres to appropriate accesibility standards. In doing this, I aim to provide a better experience for all users, including those utilising screen readers and accesibility aids. By utilising appropriate semantic HTML elements, descriptive titles and image alt tags, I also aim to optimise the Horiseon site for search engines and improve it's visibility and ranking. 

Throughout this project I learned to analyse a HTML and CSS codebase and determine where issues were occuring. From there I was able to implement appropriate restructuring and optimisation, add new elements and content where necessary, clean up existing code and ensure that the stylesheet was appropriatly organised to clairfy individual styling and positioning.
